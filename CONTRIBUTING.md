## Adding translations

To translate the letter, copy `index.md` into `_translation/`
and name it `index_lang.md` where `lang` is language code you are going to translate into.

Make sure to set `locale` to the appropriate language code. Set `image` to a translated version of social-media-preview.png, if there's any. Then you can start translating this file.

For example: `_translations/index_de.md`

```md
---
layout: signed
title: An open letter in support of Richard M. Stallman
description: An open letter in support of Richard Matthew Stallman being reinstated by the Free Software Foundation
image: /assets/social-media-preview.png
locale: de_DE
